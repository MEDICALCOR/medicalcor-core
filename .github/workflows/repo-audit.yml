Titlu: chore(ci): add repo-audit workflow

Descriere:
This PR adds a manual repository audit GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/repo-audit.yml.

What it does:
- Installs workspace dependencies (pnpm), runs typecheck, lint, tests and build across workspace packages (if present).
- Runs pnpm audit and uploads pnpm-audit.json as an artifact.
- Runs secret scanning with gitleaks and uploads gitleaks-report.json as an artifact.
- Initializes and runs CodeQL analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript (results visible under Security → Code scanning).
- Optional: If you add the CLAUDE_API_KEY secret, the workflow will run a placeholder Claude CLI step and upload claude-report.json.

How to run:
1. After merge, go to Actions → repo-audit → Run workflow (workflow_dispatch).
2. After completion, download artifacts from the Actions run page:
   - pnpm-audit (pnpm-audit.json)
   - gitleaks-report (gitleaks-report.json)
   - claude-report (if present)

Notes:
- Workflow is manual by default (workflow_dispatch).
- Do NOT add any secrets to the repo. To enable optional Claude step, add CLAUDE_API_KEY in Settings → Secrets → Actions.
