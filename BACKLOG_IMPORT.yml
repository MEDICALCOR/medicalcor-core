title: "[H1] Verify Lead → LTV Event Chain with Integration Test"
labels: ["priority: critical", "type: testing", "area: domain", "effort: 2-3h"]
milestone: "Sprint 1 - Production Critical"
body: |
  ### ID: H1

  ### Description
  The Lead → LTV business flow lacks end-to-end verification. While individual
  components work, there's no integration test proving the complete event chain:
  LeadCreated → LeadScored → LeadQualified → CaseCreated → PaymentReceived → LTVUpdated

  ### Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Integration test traces a lead from creation to LTV calculation
  - [ ] All domain events are emitted in correct order
  - [ ] Event store contains complete audit trail
  - [ ] LTV dashboard reflects accurate values after flow completion
  - [ ] Test runs in CI pipeline

labels: ["priority: critical", "type: feature", "area: cognitive-memory", "effort: 3-4h"]
milestone: "Sprint 1 - Production Critical"
body: |
  ### ID: H2

  ### Description
  The Cognitive Memory module (episode builder, memory retrieval) is fully
  implemented but not integrated into agent-facing flows. Agents don't benefit
  from patient history during calls.

  - [ ] Agent scripts receive relevant patient context from episodic memory
  - [ ] Recent interactions displayed in agent workspace (when built)
  - [ ] Semantic search used for "similar past interactions"
  - [ ] Performance: retrieval < 200ms p95

body: |
  ### ID: H4
